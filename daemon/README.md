# Holder Local Daemon

Holderd is a local-first card server, primarily used as a backend for card applications.

## What You Need

- CMake 3.22+
- Ninja
- C++20 compiler (GCC/Clang/MSVC)
- Git

Runtime/build dependencies used by this repo:

- Boost (`system`, `filesystem`)
- OpenSSL
- SQLite3
- nlohmann-json
- spdlog
- yaml-cpp
- libgit2
- md4c
- libsodium
- platform keyring support: libsecret on Linux, Keychain on macOS, Credential Manager on Windows

`./make.sh` also handles the `caste` dependency:

- Git clone: initializes submodule automatically.
- ZIP download: fetches pinned `caste` archive (requires `curl` or `wget`).

Coverage tooling (optional):

- lcov (`lcov`, `genhtml`)

Model catalog config lives at `config/models.yaml` and is served by the API at `/models.yaml`.

## Optional Runtime Dependencies

- Ollama (for local model execution via AI routes)
  - Not required to build or run the core card/project APIs.
  - Backend looks for `ollama` on `PATH` and connects to `127.0.0.1:11434` by default.
  - Override host/port with `HOLDER_MODEL_RUNNER_HOST` and `HOLDER_MODEL_RUNNER_PORT`.

## Quick Start (Ubuntu)

The idea is that it should work on any OS.

If you want to contribue instructions for your distro/Operating System,
that would be very welcome.

But here are friendly instructions for development on Ubuntu.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
  build-essential cmake ninja-build pkg-config git curl \
  libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev \
  libssl-dev \
  libsqlite3-dev nlohmann-json3-dev libspdlog-dev libyaml-cpp-dev \
  libgit2-dev libmd4c-dev catch2 libsodium-dev \
  libsecret-1-dev \
  lcov

./make.sh
```

Server will start at `127.0.0.1:11499` by default and print docs URL + auth token in the terminal log.

## Quick Start (FreeBSD)

```sh
sudo pkg install \
  cmake ninja pkgconf git curl \
  boost-libs openssl sqlite3 nlohmann-json spdlog yaml-cpp \
  libgit2 md4c catch2 libsodium

./make.sh
```

## Quick Start (Mac OS)

```sh
brew install boost openssl@3 sqlite nlohmann-json spdlog yaml-cpp libgit2 md4c catch2 libsodium lcov

./make.sh
```

## Quick Start (Windows)

I compiled it using Visual Studio (below), but there is a command line way
if you are an established dev on Windows and know what you are doing.

### Command line version

You may need this:

```powershell
$env:VCPKG_ROOT = "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\18\Community\VC\vcpkg"
```

#### Build

```powershell

cmake --preset windows-vcpkg-debug
cmake --build --preset windows-vcpkg-debug
```

The executables will be under `out/build/windows-vcpkg-debug/`

#### Test run:

```powershell
cmake --preset windows-vcpkg-tests-debug
cmake --build --preset windows-vcpkg-tests-debug
ctest --preset windows-vcpkg-tests-debug
```

Some tests are skipped on Windows because they specifically check POSIX permission bits, symlink
failure behavior, or Unix-style build-directory discovery.

### Visual Studio version

Install classic Visual Studio.

The following instructions are for the "Visual Studio Community" not "Visual Studio Code".
The one with the purple logo not the blue logo.
You probably can do it with the blue one but not with these instructions.

The installer gives you a choice of "Workloads".
Choose "Desktop Development with C++" and
accept all the options it preselects (the desktop/CMake tools).

Check out this repo with Git. Visual Studio will automatically configure it with CMake.

The first configure will take a long time as vcpkg builds the dependencies and their dependencies and so on down to the centre of the Earth (think npm or pip).

It is not as verbose as some other build tools, but if it looks frozen at any point, open the Windows Task Manager and you will see if it's busy or not.

You can also look at the installed dependency tree at `../.vcpkg-holder-daemon` and see it filling up with the
best of the last forty years of open source. It will take about 2GB.

### Building the application

Under the configurations drop-down choose `windows-vcpkg-debug`.

Then under the "Build" menu choose "Build All".

This builds the local server `holderd.exe` and the command line interface `holderctl.exe`.

Run them by selecting them as debug targets and using the Debug menu (or F5) or just run them in the command line.

### Running the test suite.

Under the configurations drop-down, choose `windows-vcpkg-tests-debug`

Then under the "Build" menu choose "Build All".

Then under the "Test" menu, go to the submenu "Run Test Preset for windows-vcpkg-tests-debug"
then click on "windows-vcpkg-tests-debug"

## Useful Commands (Linux/BSD/Mac)

```bash
./make.sh --help          # list supported build/test commands
./make.sh                 # configure + build + tests + run holder
./make.sh Debug           # debug build
./make.sh perf-privacy    # run encrypted-card perf profile table
./make.sh perf-privacy Debug
./make.sh coverage        # build + run tests + generate HTML coverage report
./make.sh warnings        # build holderd + holderctl with warnings as errors
./make.sh memcheck        # Valgrind memcheck; slow, excludes timing-sensitive tests
./make.sh san             # ASan build + tests
HOLDER_SAN_DETECT_LEAKS=1 ./make.sh san  # ASan + LSan build + tests
./make.sh san address,undefined  # ASan + UBSan build + tests
./make.sh san thread      # TSan build + tests
./build/holderd --help
./build/holderd --reindex
./scripts/cloud-smoke.sh --provider switchyard --token "$HOLDER_TOKEN" --api-key "$SWITCHYARD_API_KEY"
./scripts/factory-reset.sh --force  # This wipes all user data, useful for development and testing the onboarding path. Warning: don't use on the actual holder instance you use as a user.
```

The opt-in local MinIO and hosted S3-compatible storage test is documented in
[`docs/s3-compatible-smoke-test.md`](docs/s3-compatible-smoke-test.md).

## Daemons.

In computing, a daemon is a program that runs as a background process,
rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user.
Sometimes this is called a service, a server or a backend,
but the original term from 1963 is a daemon,
based on the Ancient Greek word δαίμων.
This is a different word than demon, used in later Christian tradition for fallen angel.
Socrates described a daemon as an "attendant, ministering, or indwelling spirit; genius",
more like the Holy Spirit.
Demons are baddies, daemons are goodies.
